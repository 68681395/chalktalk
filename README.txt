This version of Chalktalk requires node.js to run.
Here are the instructions for getting started:

(1) Go to http://nodejs.org/download/ and download node.js

(2) In the chalktalk/server folder, type:

	npm install

(3) To run Chalktalk, type in this folder:

	run

Here are some useful things to know:

The toggle key to show/hide all the hotkey commands and also to
show outlines around sketches is 'x'.

The key to show/hide the glyphs dictionary (defined by all the *.js
files in the sketches/ directory) is '='.

To try creating your own sketch type, copy any of the *.js files in
the sketches/ folder to a new .js file.  In your new file, change the
value of this.label, and customize it to draw a different shape.
