# Chrome Issues?
Sometimes, Chrome on Macbooks doesn't realize it should use the discrete card or the on-board card for WebGL. 
If you run Chalktalk and get the "Cannot initialize WebGL Renderer" error, use a tool like gfxCardStatus or other
to force your Macbook to use the discrete card, then kill Chrome and restart it.

The issue seems to be that recent versions of Chrome don't know how to initialize WebGL properly on machines
with multiple GPU options such as certain models of MacbookPro.
