**Chalktalk** is a digital presentation and communication language 
in development at New York University's Future Reality Lab.
Using a blackboard-like interface, it allows a presenter to create and interact
with animated digital sketches in order to demonstrate ideas and concepts (especially in the sciences) in the context
of a live presentation or conversation.

Sketches can display 2D and 3D graphics, move and animate, respond to input and output, and be linked together to allow for more complex logical connections and behaviors.

A growing library of sketches--from creatures to math and physics objects--is available,
and Chalktalk continues to evolve.

### Requirements
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) & npm
* Python

### Installation and Usage
See wiki.

### Creating and Contributing

Contributions to the core code-base and sketch library are welcome.

To try creating your own sketch, create a new .js file (nameOfMySketch.js) 
or copy a template (from sketches/templates) into the sketches directory. 

In your file, change the value of `this.label` and begin customizing your new sketch.
